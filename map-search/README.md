# Map Search Project

**Tech:** Python, Data Structures, Algorithms  

This project implements three graph search algorithms (**BFS, DFS, and A\*** ) to compute routes on street maps with different optimization goals.  

### Features
- Implemented custom **Queue** and **Stack** data structures (`push`, `pop`, `clear`, string representation).
- Compared search algorithm performance on maps of different sizes.
- Visualized paths to evaluate efficiency and tradeoffs.

### How to Run
1. Hit the **Run** button on the left of this CodeSkulptor link:  
   ðŸ‘‰ https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user310_hNGraxS53m_1.py
2. Or copy `main.py` into an empty [CodeSkulptor](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/) file and run.

# Yurie Han â€” Portfolio
# Hi! I'm Yurie ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **software, hardware, and data enthusiast** who enjoys building interactive projects, machine learning experiments, and embedded/IoT prototypes. My current focus is on **ML model prototyping** and **embedded systems**. 

Iâ€™ve previously interned at **Samsung**, **Cisco**, and **Warner Bros. Games**, gaining experience across hardware, software, and machine learnning projects.  

ðŸŽ“ I'm an Oregon native and graduated from **Rice University** with a B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering (minors in Data Science and Art History). Iâ€™m now pursuing an **M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering** at **USC**, specializing in Machine Learning and Data Science. My graduate studies are supported by a full-tuition scholarship generously funded by Meta.  

- ðŸ’» **Languages & tools:** Python, C/C++, Rust, R, SQL, MATLAB, Verilog, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Spark, AWS, Linux, Git

## Projects in this repository

1. **Map Search** â€” `mapsearch/`  | Python, Data Structures, Algorithms
   * Implemented three graph search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A* ) to compute routes on street maps with different optimization goals
   * Built custom Queue and Stack data structures supporting push, pop, clear, and string representation methods
   & Compared algorithm performance on varying map sizes to evaluate efficiency and pathfinding tradeoffs.
See the folder for code and run instructions.

2. **Colab Notebook Project** â€” `project2-colab/`  
   Data analysis / ML experiment with notebook and report. The `.ipynb` and `report.pdf` are in the folder.

## How to run things
- CodeSkulptor project: copy `project1-codeskulptor/main.py` into https://py3.codeskulptor.org/ and run.  
- Colab notebook: open `project2-colab/notebook.ipynb` in Colab (or download and run locally).  
- PDFs and reports are viewable directly on GitHub.
